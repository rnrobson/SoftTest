# Debugging

Debugging is the process of locating and fixing bugs in programs. This is one of the programmers least liked activities. It can be frustrating, labor intensive, and sometimes downright painful. His programmers mature, they realized that it is often better to write the code carefully and avoid bugs that it is to go through the pain or finding and fixing the bugs.

The debugging process is similar to being a detective. You take a look at your program and you see that it is not performing as it should. The fact that it's not performing correctly is evidence which you can then use to try and determine the location of the bug. In many cases the evidence that is immediately available is not sufficient to locate the bug and you have to gain more evidence. The techniques to gain more evidence include:

- inserting print statements to determine where the code is executing and what the values of variables are.

- Creating a log file which will capture the output of numerous print statements to give you an up to date picture of what the software has been doing.

- Using an interactive debugger to stop the program in mid execution and examine the state of the variables. Debuggers also allow you to resume execution step by step and watch the program as it executes and examine the values of the variables as they change during execution.

Which of these debugging techniques you use depends greatly on the tools you have available to you as well as the type of program you were trying to debug. For a simple program that is relatively short, inserting some print statements might be the simplest way to gather the evidence. In other cases you might have a distributed program which is running on multiple computers over a network. In this situation, it is difficult to gather up all the data from all the different machines and log files are the best solution. For programs running on a single machine that are more complicated, then interactive debuggers are usually the best choice. Nothing says you have to use just one technique since you can combine different techniques depending on the type of problem you're dealing with.

One of the difficulties of a print statement is that output is usually buffered. This means that when a program terminates suddenly, output can be left in a buffer and never actually a print on the screen or other output device. This can cause the programmer to believe that the code was in a different position than it really was when it terminated. To get around this problem, you should flush the output streams regularly to make sure that no output is left in the buffers when the program terminates abnormally.

## Types of Errors

Computers have two very different types of errors. One is the syntactic error which is when your program does not follow the rules of the programming language. Syntactic errors are picked up by the compiler at compile time and generate either a warning or an error. Warnings do not stop the execution of your program but they do indicate that the compiler has detected that you are doing something very unusual. Many students ignore warnings because they do not stop the program from executing. However, warnings should not be ignored as they often give a clue as to a problem which has yet to manifest itself. Errors actually stopped the compiler from generating the code and they are far more serious violations of the programming language syntax. Errors must be corrected before you can generate working code.

Fortunately, the compiler produces good error messages which usually tell you the exact line that has the problem and give an indication of what the problem is. While these messages might appear cryptic when you first see them, as you get more experienced, you will find that they are actually quite easy to decipher.

C compilers are very good add generating a large number of compile time error messages. These messages are often much larger than the actual cause of the messages. Often, many messages can be generated from something as simple as forgetting to include a header file. Just because the compiler says your program has 200 error messages doesn't mean that there are 200 separate errors you need to fix. It could be that there are only about a dozen. It is common for an error in a header file to be included into multiple implementation files resulting in the replication of error messages.

The other type of error is a runtime error or what we call a semantic error. These occur because your program doesn't do the right thing. You detect them when you run the program by observing that the program fails or by observing that it produces incorrect output. These semantic errors are often far more difficult to find than the syntactic errors. We will not spend a lot of time on syntactic errors in this course and will concentrate primarily on semantic errors.

## Debugging Techniques

There are numerous techniques you can use to try and track down the bugs in a program. When you are tracking down bugs, you need to know several pieces of information:

- Where the program was executing when the bug occurred.

- Whether the point of termination of the program was where the bug occurred or whether the bug occurred long before the program terminated,

- In many cases the program will not terminate but rather simply produce incorrect results. In situations like this you have to start looking at the code that calculated those results and try and figure out what went wrong with the calculations.

- Often when you see a program executing a certain piece of code you are mystified as how it got to execute that piece of code. In situations like this you try and answer the question how did I end up executing this piece of code?

- Often you need to see the values of individual variables and watch them change to figure out exactly what is going wrong.
  Debugging can be very complicated and many bugs our elusive and very difficult to track down. Finding these bugs can be both frustrating and very time consuming. The answer to how to find them is usually one of cleverness and persistence. Sometimes a bug can take weeks to find. Fortunately, as you become more experienced, you get better at finding bugs and getting an intuition as to what causes a particular type of problem.

## Debugging Clues

As you gain experience, you will find that there are certain giveaways as to what might be the source of the bug. Bugs which totally stump novice programmers are often solved in a couple of minutes by experienced programmers. Below I will go through some of the most common reasons for bugs and how to identify them.

### Segmentation Faults

Modern computers and operating systems have the concept of protected memory. This means that they are easily able to recognize memory which is allocated for use by your program versus memory which has been allocated for use by another program. If your program attempts to access memory that has been not allocated for your program then it generates a segmentation fault. The segmentation fault normally results in the termination of the program. The most common reasons for a segmentation fault are:

- Having subscripts which run off the end of an array. If the array is stored near the boundary of your program and another program then incorrect subscripts can cause you to access the memory outside of the memory for your own program when you get a segmentation fault, looking for bad subscript's on arrays is one of the first things you should do.

- Another common reason for segmentation faults is a bad address. When you were using pointers you can get a pointer which points to memory outside the memory allocated to your program. This results in some kind of an error in calculating the pointer. Since the pointer accesses memory outside of your programs memory, it generates a segmentation fault.

- The third, and less common reason for a segmentation fault, would be an uninitialised variable. Some compilers make it difficult to have uninitialized variables while other compilers allow the use of uninitialized variables. Uninitialized variables can have random values depending on where they occur. In general, we treat an initialized variable as having a random value and if this variable is used as a pointer it can often address memory outside of your program.

- one of the most common values to cause a segmentation fault is a null pointer. NULL has the value zero and this references part of the operating system. If you find that the pointer that caused the segmentation fault has the value of NULL or zero then you should figure out why it was not calculated to have the correct value.

- Another problem which can cause a bus error is attempting to access memory which has been deallocated. Once you start doing dynamic memory allocation, it is possible for you to keep pointers to memory that you've already deallocated. Attempting to use these pointers to access the memory which has been deallocated can result in a segmentation fault.

### Bus Error

The bus error is similar to the segmentation fault in that it is in illegal memory access. The difference between the two is that segmentation fault address is valid memory that is not allocated to your program whereas a bus error access is memory which does not exist. The reasons for the bus error are similar to that of a segmentation fault and you should follow them down using the same debugging techniques.

### Random Behaviour

Random behavior where your program behaves differently every time it is run is almost always a result of uninitialized variables. The reason the program is behaving randomly is because every time it accesses the value that was in that location previously period since that value is probably close to random, it causes your program to behave in a different way every time it is run. Whenever you see random behavior, the first thing to look for is uninitialized variables.

### Program Executes The Wrong Code

Occasionally, you will find that your program is executing code that there is no way it should have been executing. When you look at a stack trace, you might find part of a stack trace missing. These are symptoms that there is a much larger problem in your program. It means that your program took a random jump and ended up in some code that it shouldn't have ended up here. This could be a bad pointer or it could be some strange problem with the program. This is one of the most difficult and challenging bugs to identify.

### My Variable Just Changed it’s Value

if you ever find that a variable seems to have changed its value on its own, then some other piece of code must have changed the value. Tracking down this other piece of code which changed the value can be particularly difficult. Often it is the result of running off the end of an array or using a bad pointer which does not reach outside your memory space for your program but just access is valid memory within your program.

Compilers generally layout memory linearly as the variables are declared. Take a look at where you declared the variable whose value is being changed. If you find it is declared right before or after an array then check to make sure that the bounds of those arrays are not being exceeded. On the other hand if it is caused by a bad pointer, it can be very difficult to locate where the bad pointer was generated. Some debuggers have a watch feature where you can watch a particular memory location and have the debugger notify you whenever that location is changed. This is one of a few techniques that will help you debug this type of problem.

### My Program Works on One Compiler and Fails on Another

Most students think that this is a fault of the computer or the compiler. While it is possible that the computer or the compiler can make mistakes this is extremely rare. These compilers are used by thousands and thousands of people every day and if there is a bug in them it is found and corrected quickly. It is far more likely that the problem is in your program.

The reasons why programs behave differently on different compilers and operating systems is because there are different compilers in different operating systems do different things. For example, on Unix operating systems memory is usually not zeroed out before being given to a new program. On windows you could always depend on your memory to have been zeroed out before being handed to your program. The other big difference is in how we compilers layout and allocate memory. Some compilers will do byte alignment where they extend variables to give them a little extra space for the word size of a particular computer. If you switch to a computer with a different word size then it will have different padding between variables to make sure that the variables start on a word boundary. This small difference in spacing can result in a program working on one compiler but failing on another compiler. The real reason for this is most likely you've either got in index exceeding the bounds of an array or an invalid pointer. On one of the compilers this bad memory address simply accesses some of the empty space between the variables used for padding whereas in the other compiler it accesses a real variable and corrupts its value. The fault for this lies not with the compilers but rather with your program. If your program was working perfectly it would work perfectly on both compilers.

### My Program Just Stopped!

If you find that your program stops in the middle of execution for no reason, you should consider the possibility that you might have handled and exception or a signal. C programs allow you to install signal handlers that will intercept signals sent to your program and do something with them. These signal handlers can catch segmentation faults and bus errors and allow the program to continue to execute. The reason the signal handlers are available is to allow the programmer to catch erroneous conditions and to try and do something intelligent to recover from them. Many students find the signals that are causing the program to stop execution to be very annoying and they install a signal handler which does nothing. This can have very strange effects. It creates a program which should have stopped yet is continuing to blunder along. What exactly will happen with this program is almost impossible to predict.

Most languages have some kind of an exception facility where code which has some kind of a problem will throw an exception. Exceptions can be caught in some kind of a try-catch statement and then handled to try and recover from the error. Once again many programmers find these errors inconvenient so they install a try catch which catches the exceptions and does nothing. If your program just stops without any error messages then you should consider the possibility that you have put some erroneous code inside a try-catch, it throws an exception, you catch the exception, and do nothing. The operating system then terminates your program and it has the appearance that it just stopped. Catching an exception and doing nothing is usually a bad idea.

### Memory Errors

!["Application memory layout" ](/img/memory-layout.jpg)

Computer memory for an application is divided into four main parts:

- an area for constants. When you create a constant in a program, it is tored directly in the image to be stored on disk. This means that the constaatns are loaded into memory along with the executable code. This saves having to assign values to them at run-time since their values are assigned as part of the loading of the program.
- An area holding the executable code. This is the binary representation of the code you wrote in a high-level language that is ready to run.
- A stack onto which stack frames are placed every time a function is called. The stack frames contain the memory for all the local variables inside the function. Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created for it and, when the function returns, the stack frame is removed from the run-time stack. The next function call will place a new frame on the stack which will overwrite a previous stack frame, destroying any values stored there. When you inherit space on the stack which was used previously, it will have the values from the previous function in it and you need to initialize all your variables to avoid getting random values in them.
- A heap from which memory can be dynamically allocated. This is what is used when you use the _new_ and _delete_ operators in C++ or the _allocate_ and _free_ functions in C. The heap is automatically managed to find memory of the size you need and to make memory that was freed available for reuse. These algorithms get very confused if you delete the same memory twice, leading to unpredictable errors.

Some languages, like Java and C#, offer _managed memory_. This means that there is a _new_ operator to allocate a new object but no _delete_ operator to make the memory available again. These languages keep a count of the number of references there are in a program to each dynamically allocated variable. When that count drops to zero, no one is useing the variable anymore and it is marked available for reuse. A separate thread runs a _garbage collector_ which is responsible for gathering up these variables and making them available to be used again. Some of these languages allow you to give hints to the garbage collector to run and reclaim memory. This can give your program more heap memory when it starts to run out and there is free memory which just needs to be made available.

One thing that can go wrong with memory is to exhaust the stack space. This happens because you've called so many functions that you have literally used up all the memory allocated for the runtime stack. The possible reasons for this include:

- You're storing a very large number of local variables or large arrays as local variables inside the functions. If this is the case then you should consider reducing these number of variables or using dynamic allocation to allocate the space from the heap rather than from the stack.
- You have a case of infinite recursion. Recursion is defined as when a function calls itself. This might be either directly where the function calls itself or indirectly where a function calls another function which then calls the original function. Regardless of how it happens if you are in a situation where you call a function recursively forever you eventually exhaust the stack space. Finding infinite recursion is relatively easy because if you put a few printf statements in the functions you will find that you print out large numbers of them where the infinite recursion is occurring. Once you find the location of recursion find a way to break it and your problem will be solved.

You could also exhaust the heap memory. Exhausting heap memory occurs because you allocated too much memory, which is actually fairly rare or you have a _memory leak_. A memory leak is when you allocate memory but you never free it. This is actually very simple to do in the C language and it's hard to find out where it's occurring and to avoid it. Getting large C and C++ applications so that they do not have memory leaks is actually a difficult tasks. There are automated tools that can try and detect where this might be occurring but the best thing to do is to use smart pointers that automatically deallocate heap memory when it goes out of scope. While this solves the problem of heap memory which is only needed for the lifetime of a function it doesn't do much to solve problems of heap memory which is needed for a longer duration.

The other problem that can occur with the heap is that if you delete the same memory twice or you try and use a pointer to memory which has already been deleted, you can end up with some very strange errors. These errors can be very difficult to locate and fix.

### Linker Errors

As you might remember, a program is often put together from multiple dot obj files along with library files. The linker is the piece of software which puts all these parts of your program together to make a single executable. In general, the linker has two problems:

1. Your code used a function or variable which cannot be found. The reasons for this include a spelling mistake, where you spelled the name of a functional variable incorrectly. Sometimes you have written the declaration all the function but forgot to write the body of the function. When the linker goes looking for the code, it cannot find it and generates an error. The other reason for this error could be that part of a code was forgotten and not passed to the linker. If this is the case, it indicates that there is a problem with your Visual Studio project or your makefile if you are running on a Unix system.

2. Your code declared the same variable or function twice. You might have used the same variable or function name twice in different files, or accidentally declared the body of a function twice. In both of these cases, the linker does not know which one to pick. Rather than randomly selecting one of the possibilities, it throws an error stopping the generation of the executable.

Almost all linker errors can be tracked down to one of these two causes. The other reason you may get a message when you were trying to generate an executable is because the executable file is already running. If you are running an executable file the compiler cannot overwrite it. Check to make sure that you are not running any of your executable files before trying to recompile them.
